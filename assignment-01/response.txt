How is the web different than the internet?
 The internet contains participants while the web supplies the information. The internet is what connects us to information, the web is the information itself.

Briefly describe how the internet works.
  The internet is a cable that servers are connected to. The servers are internet or other providers that give us access to the internet and its resources.
  Servers and other internet accessing devices have an IP address that make it unique and accessable. For me to send a message to someone else, it has to reach
  the internet cable or something attatched to it. So since my phone does not have a cable attached to it that connects directly, I have to connect through a
  different way. My message is directed through a path of routers that guides my message to the internet cable that travels through more routhers that helps my
  message reach the desired recipiant.
  
What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?
  A directory is like a big folder in which other folders can be stored. Its the file cabinet where files and projects are stored. This helps with the 
  organization of files and being more easily accessible.
    
Why is using a VCS beneficial?
  VCS is beneficial because it tracks project progress and updated versions to help adapt and improve programs. If an update is made that destroys code or doesn't work 
  well, we can trace back to the previous version and restart from there. It makes it easy to see problems and create solutions. It also allows others to 
  adapt previous versions of the code without directly affecting the newest version.
