6. The way data travels on the internet is similar to a delivery service.
A request or order is made from a computer with an IP Address and the computer
that has the information receives the request, and fulfills it if possible.
The information knows where to go kind of like how Amazon navigates to your
house once you place an order. It knows your address and there are many ways
to get to the address, so routers are able to control web traffic to ensure
the package gets to its destination in the quickest time.

7. An IP Address is the computers address. A DNS address stands for Domain Name
Service and refers to a hosting service provided by that IP Address. Domains
use the alphabet instead of a chain of numbers to contact and find a website.
A Domain is something you pay for so that people can find your information on
the internet.

8. Cookies help websites remember you so they can customize messages and the
advertisements that show up. A website will assign you an ID so next time you
visit their site, they know what you like. When you fill out information or
make a certain search, the cite may remember it as a cookie, something you
enjoy, so that next time you visit their cite, they show you a cookie, something
you like.

9. The three parts of a URL are the protocol, the domain name, and the path.
