1. The way browsers function is, a request is sent to a server for content, the server responds with the web content,  then the browser interprets and displays the content on a page. Browsers have different components that make them work. One of the components is a user interface which is what the viewer sees. Next component is a rendering engine which is in charge of displaying the content visually to the viewer. Another component is the browser engine which directs actions between the server and the rendering engine. Then there is the browsers connection to the network, responsible for retrieving information. Next is a Javascript interpreter which helps the browser run. Finally is data storage which helps keep information even after refreshing the page. Personally, I use Google Chrome most often.

2. Markup is a language that focuses on the text content of a given page, like how it appears and is laid out.
