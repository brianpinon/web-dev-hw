      <h1>About the Author</h1>
      <p>Christopher Poindexter is a bohemian poet who began writing poetry
        on a rebellious trip to California when he was 18. He considers himself
        more of an observer, trying to make sense of the human condition in all
        of its grit and glory. Being very inspired by both the darkness and
        the light, he aims to share an ultimate truth in all of his writing;
        though we all have our dances with demons, our hearts haunted by loss,
        by fear, it is the light that always beckons us. Calls out our name in
        even the darkest hours. This is why we must love one another.
        Because we are not alone in this.</p>
