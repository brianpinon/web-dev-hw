# Assignment 06
## Brian Pinon

1. There are a lot of forms on CyberBear and the University
of Montana website. The forms I saw were to collect data so
the cite could take you where you need to go. For example,
choosing Fall 2020 from a drop down menu so you are able to
select classes for the correct term.

2. Text input is used anytime you use a search bar so there
are many examples all throughout the internet. Selection
input can be used when taking a survey online to select a
finite amount of options. Button input can be used as a
final way to collect information or to submit an entry or gather or upload information. For example, on Moodle you are able to upload a submission through a button input.

3. This assignment had lots of new code and ways to do things, there were options on how to display information which made it unique and fun. Tables were a little confusing at first but I put placeholder text in each cell so I could easily edit it later with the correct information. I am learning the importance of line breaks and paragraphs to better display and organize information. I searched the web for ways to add space between elements on the same line so I could make my radio selection elements look more organized. I hope we can learn more ways to style a table or add color to cells to make the information look more clear and professional.
