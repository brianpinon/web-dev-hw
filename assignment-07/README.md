1. Divs help style elements and information in a group. It can take a style and apply it to a whole group of elements and they can also be added to each other, meaning you can combine multiple divs. Divs are a block level element.
Spans are an inline element that can change the style in one line. This is like using a strong or italic tag mid sentence but using a styling group instead.
Ids help classify or label certain divs to stay organized and specify which div is being addressed.
Classes help style whole blocks of code. They are similar to Ids but Ids are unique where classes are not. Classes can be used multiple times and to different things and Ids have to remain unique and specific.

2. Alt text is helpful if the media we are trying to show cannot load or be rendered. This way if something fails, there is not a blank space, but alternate text explaining what is missing or not loading.

3. This assignment was actually really fun. I love the styling and using div's. The walkthrough video is very helpful, they all are and make things easy to follow along with while also making me problem solve on my own. I had a few problems when embedding the media logo and video in the Copyright section. There were a lot of quotations and I was having a hard time telling Atom what text went where. The wrong things were the wrong colors and I added and deleted quotations until the words and information were the right color and being defined correctly. Other than that, this assignment was fun and I am getting even more comfortable in code and learning more.
