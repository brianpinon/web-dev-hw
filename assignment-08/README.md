# Assignment 08
## Brian Pinon

1. I felt like this was the first time we had to figure out the
whole assignment by ourselves. The walkthrough video helped get
started and then we had to add all the elements. I like this
assignment because the options were limitless to how we could make
our website. Choosing colors and formatting it was fun and required
some research and looking over the study slides again. I think the
main thing I learned was all the different ways to align elements.

2. I'm excited to learn how to incorporate animations and things
that move or change when you scroll or move the mouse over it. Drop
down menus or things that make the site look less like it is amature
or from a long time ago.

3. My work cycle was all over the place for this assignment. I was going through the websites instructions and looking for code or trying to remember how to correctly do something. I would go to old assignments and copy and past pre-existing code and then modify it to fit my website for the assignment. I tried and failed a lot of times, sometimes refreshing the page and seeing that nothing changed or that chunks of information disappeared. So trial and error and cross referencing was most of this assignment and trying to find the best way to display all the information. This assignment really helped me appreciate website builders so you don't have to manually do all this stuff on your own. I could see how adding padding and spacing would be difficult and making the site look pretty.
