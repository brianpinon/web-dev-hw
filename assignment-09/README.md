1. You can only use an id once in your code so it should be a one time occurrence of something you do not need to replicate over and over again. Universal applies to the whole scope of work so it makes big changes in unison. A class is better used for medium sized chunks of code where you want to apply a style or attribute to a series or grouping of code. I would choose a universal element to declare a certain font or perhaps padding to the left. I would use a class element to organize large paragraphs or text that changes alignment. I would use an id to stylize one specific attribute about something like a title or a description.  

2. The color palette I used was one based off of images I found and included in my website. I samples colors from pictures and found their hex-codes and added them to the color palette. I tried to use colors that I found most often and commonly when searching in the year 1950. I chose four colors:
#e83f2e #e9b144 #312e59 #1d673f

3. There was a lot of content to go over and learn in the class website but it was all beneficial and helpful for this assignment. Using opacity was pretty simple and learning about color was my favorite. Again, stylizing things is fun but sometimes bothersome when you can't figure out how to tell your computer to do what you want. I think the position element was the most difficult for me to understand and incorporate in my code. I changed themes and colors of the website a lot and installing the color picker was very helpful.
