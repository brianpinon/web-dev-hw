1. System fonts are fonts that are on your personal computer, that live in your files. System fonts help you match fonts across all visuals if you are running a business or use the same font and desire cohesion across all platforms. When system fonts are used on a web platform, the website uses a picture of the font, which slows down load time and isn't as editable. Web fonts are fonts that have saved and editable data that appear better on the web and can be more easily styled. Web safe fonts are web fonts that can still render even if the web or location were to malfunction or go down. These fonts will always be seen no matter what happens to the host or files.

2. Fall back fonts and font stacks help if something goes wrong with the desired font. This could either mean that it was typed wrong, linked incorrectly or someone else does not have access to it. fall back fonts help you make it so that even if something goes wrong in summoning your desired font, a similar style can still be achieved.

3. This assignment was fun to play with, I love fonts. The Google Fonts resource is so much fun and very handy. I think what took me longest was finding a passage or written work that I wanted to document. Then came styling it in a way I liked and how I thought would match the content. This assignment was fairly straight forward and it was so full learning about different typography elements such as tracking and leading.
