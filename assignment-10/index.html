    <h1>Virtues Leared in Substance Recovery</h1>
    <h2><i>David Foster Wallace - Infinite Jest (1996)</i></h2>
    </div>

    <div class="text">
      <p>If, by the virtue of charity or the circumstance of desperation, you
        ever chance to spend a little time around a Substance-recovery halfway
        facility like Enfield MA’s state-funded Ennet House, you will acquire
        many exotic new facts…</p>

      <p>That certain persons simply will not like you no matter what you do.</p>

      <p>That sleeping can be a form of emotional escape and can with sustained
        effort be abused. That purposeful sleep-deprivation
        can also be an abusable escape.</p>

      <p>That you do not have to like a person in order to learn from him/her/it.
        That loneliness is not a function of solitude. That logical validity is
        not a guarantee of truth. That it takes <i>effort</i> to pay attention to any
        one stimulus for more than a few seconds. That boring activities become,
        perversely, much less boring if you concentrate intently on them. That
        if enough people in a silent room are drinking coffee it is possible to
        make out the sound of steam coming off the coffee. That sometimes human
        beings have to just sit in one place and, like, <i>hurt</i>. That you will
        become way less concerned with what other people think of you when you
        realize how seldom they do. That there is such a thing as
        <i>raw, unalloyed, agendaless kindness.</i></p>

      <p>That it is possible to fall asleep during an anxiety attack.</p>

      <p>That concentrating intently on anything is very hard work.</p>

      <p>That 99% of compulsive thinkers’ thinking is about themselves; that 99%
        of this self-directed thinking consists of imagining and then getting
        ready for things that are going to happen to them; and then, weirdly, that
        if they stop to think about it, that 100% of the things they spend 99% of
        their time and energy imagining and trying to prepare for all the
        contingencies and consequences of are never good. In short that 99% of
        the head’s thinking activity consists of trying to scare the everliving
        shit out of itself. That it is possible to make rather tasty poached eggs
        in a microwave oven. That some people’s moms never taught them to cover
        up or turn away when they sneeze. That the people to be the most frightened
        of are the people who are the most frightened. That it takes great
        personal courage to let yourself appear weak. That no single, individual
        moment is in and of itself unendurable.</p>

      <p>That other people can often see things about you that you yourself
        cannot see, even if those people are stupid. That having a lot of money
        does not immunize people from suffering or fear. That trying to dance
        sober is a whole different kettle of fish.</p>

      <p>That different people have <i>radically</i> different ideas of basic personal hygiene.</p>

      <p>That, perversely, it is often more fun to want something than to have it.</p>

      <p>That if you do something nice for somebody in secret, anonymously,
        without letting the person you did it for know it was you or anybody else
        know what it was you did or in any way or form trying to get credit for it,
        it’s almost its own form of intoxicating buzz.</p>

      <p>That anonymous generosity, too, can be abused.</p>

      <p>That it is permissible to want.</p>

      <p>That everybody is identical in their unspoken belief that way deep down
        they are <i>different</i> from everyone else. That this isn’t necessarily perverse.</p>

      <p>That there might not be angels, but there are people who might
        as well be angels.</p>
