1. Padding puts user defined space between different elements which help the website breath. It is like adding spaces or empty pixels in any direction. Borders also create space but in a more visual way. You can add colors to borders and also choose which side it should appear on like padding but borders can have a style and radius. Margins mostly deals with the parent element and adds space between them. It controls the space between boxes at a higher level.

3. I think this was definitely one of the harder assignments we've done so far. Dealing with centering and alignment and margins and borders is a bit of a headache and little mistakes can be hard to track and fix. I followed along with the walkthrough after many failed attempts at trying on my own, but still made my own touches and changed some things. I love using pseduo-class elements especially adding a hover feature. I am again and again realizing how important organization is and how to do it better which helps me debug or easily find my struggle. Overall, it was fun to make a website that looks more professional and is easy to use!
