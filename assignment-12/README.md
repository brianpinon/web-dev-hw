# Assignment 12

1. My imaginary client was an upcoming coffee shop that wanted a website to be more accessible and acknowledged by people in the city. They needed basic information and navigation to assist their clients needs and questions.

2. display: inline; forces elements to stay in a single line or block. They do not force new lines but also ignore margins.
display: inline-block; also forces elements to stay in a line or block but it abides to the margins and stays within the bounds. You need to set the width.
display: block; can turn into inline or inline-block, it usually spans the whole horizontal distance of the page.

3. This assignment was definitely the hardest one so far. The walkthrough was helpful but with css it was just the tip of the iceberg. I had a hard time aligning the social media elements and working between different style sheets. I kept making changes to the index and then had to copy and paste the new code into all the other elements so everything displayed the same on each tab. Making the dropdown menu made sense but was hard to follow in practice.
