# Assignment 13
# Brian Pi√±on

1. For this assignment I rearranged the previous assignment to better fit and suit me. So anything I added was information I learned from earlier in the course.

2. Again, I have learned so much this whole class, this assignment was like the compilation of all that I have learned. These two weeks working on this assignment wasn't necessarily full of new learning, just applying all of the knowledge I've obtained this semester.

3. I started with my past assignment, assignment 12, then tweaked and changed it till I was happy with it. This website would be helpful if I were to try and employ my talents for working for other people.
